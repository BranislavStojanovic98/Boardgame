# Boardgame

A fun boardgame that plays like Man, Don't Get Angry.
Point of the game is to be the first player that reaches 10 points
Point is awarded by passing entire board without getting terminated by other players and by terminating other players.
Point is lost if a player is terminated by another player.

There are 4 players and each player starts in different corner of the map.
Game is played by having players move forward on the board from their starting position.
The amount of fields a player passes in a single turn is determined by a throw of a 6-sided dice.
When a player places on a field that already has another(second) player on it and that field is not the starting position of second player, then the second player is terminated and the first player gets a point.
